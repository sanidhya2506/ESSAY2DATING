*Fall in love with a story, not a profile.*

## 🧠 What is Essay2Dating?

**Essay2Dating** is a minimalist dating platform concept designed to help people connect through **words, values, and trust** rather than photos and superficial profiles.

Instead of swiping, users:
- Write honest essays about themselves
- Ask friends, colleagues, or trusted people to vouch for them
- Read other people’s stories
- Send connection requests only when they genuinely feel aligned

The platform encourages **slow dating**, reflection, and meaningful connections.

## ✨ Core Philosophy

> Modern dating apps prioritize appearance.  
> Essay2Dating prioritizes understanding.

- No swipes  
- No filters  
- No profile pictures  
- Just stories, references, and intent

---

## 📄 Pages & Flow

Essay2Dating consists of **four core pages**, forming a complete MVP flow:

### 🏠 Home (`index.html`)
- Introduces the idea and philosophy
- Explains why Essay2Dating exists
- Entry point to join, vouch, or browse

---

### 📝 Join / Read (`create.html`)
- Users write an honest essay about themselves
- Essays are submitted via **Google Forms**
- This acts as the “profile creation” step

---

### 🤝 Vouch (`reference.html`)
- Friends, colleagues, or close contacts submit references
- Adds credibility and social proof
- Helps others understand the person beyond self-description

---

### 👀 View (`view.html`)
- Users read essays and references submitted by others
- No swiping — only reading and reflection
- If a user feels a connection, they can send a **connection request**

---

## 🔍 Connection Request System (No Backend)

Essay2Dating intentionally avoids a backend in its MVP stage.

### How requests work:
- Clicking **“Send Request”** opens a Google Form
- The interested user submits:
  - Their name
  - Their contact information
  - A short message explaining why they want to connect
- Requests are collected in Google Sheets
- Connections are shared **only with consent**

This keeps the system:
✔ Simple  
✔ Private  
✔ Safe  
✔ Scalable later
